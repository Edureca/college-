             started its journey in 1879. Being the first women's college in India as well as in Asia, Bethune College produced the
              first two female graduates of the entire British colonial Empire who made their mark, left significant contributions and 
              inspired generations to come. Since its establishment, Bethune College has helped in enlightening women's lives by playing

            The journey of Bethune College began on 16th June, 1879. The Calcutta Gazette published the news of appointment
             of Baboo Sosi Bhusan Dutt, (Lecturer of Ravenshaw College, Cuttack) on 16th June, 1879 as the First Lecturer of the
              College Department of Bethune School. Therefore, 16th June, 1879 has been accepted as the foundation day of Bethune College.
            <h2>Vision</h2>
              The vision of the institution is to mold students into dynamic global citizens who are intellectually stimulated, 
              technologically equipped, socially aware, and sympathetic by providing value-based and quality education. The college
               aims to impart lifelong learning so that our students become better human beings, retaining a fine sense of balance 
               between traditional values and modern perspectives.
              The institution is committed to the cause of empowerment of women from all sectors including
               those who are socially and economically deprived through access to higher education. The College has always attempted
                to support and sustain the vision of John Elliot Drinkwater Bethune who paved the path of progress for women by
                 liberating them from their shackled existences and by illuminating their future with the help of education.
                  Keeping in mind the changing contours of education in the current era, the institution aims to become a vibrant
                   knowledge center in teaching, research, and extension activities.
<h2>Mission</h2>
The mission of Bethune College is to endow its learners with access to higher education that promotes capacity building and holistic
 development through a quality teaching-learning process.
The institution aims to create honest citizens who preserve their rich cultural past and are professionally skilled in their own fields.
The College strives to provide comprehensive education, inculcates ethical and moral values, and encourages students to enhance
 their leadership and entrepreneurial qualities.
The college's mission is dynamic and periodically reviewed to meet the challenges and opportunities of changing times.
